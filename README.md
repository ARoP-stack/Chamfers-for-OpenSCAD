# OpenSCAD-Chamfer
A library to create primitives with 45° chamfers in OpenSCAD.

## What it does
The commands `chamferCube` and `chamferCylinder` can be used to create chamfered versions of the existing `cube` and `cylinder` commands.

The Chamfers are always at a 45° angle to the ground plane and are printable in a good quality on Fused deposition modelling (FDM) printers.
